App Idea: FitnessBuddy
I would like to build an app called "FitnessBuddy" that serves as a comprehensive fitness and wellness companion. The app aims to help users lead healthier lives by providing personalized workout plans, nutrition guidance, and mental well-being resources. Users can input their fitness goals, preferences, and any health restrictions, and the app will create a tailored workout plan and suggest meal options accordingly. Additionally, the app will offer guided meditation sessions and mindfulness exercises to support mental wellness.

Key Features:

Personalized Workouts: Users can choose from various workout styles (e.g., cardio, strength training, yoga) and specify their fitness level. The app generates customized workout routines with video demonstrations and tracks progress over time.
Nutrition Guidance: FitnessBuddy suggests meal plans based on dietary preferences, goals, and restrictions. Users can log their meals, track calories, and receive nutritional insights.
Mindfulness and Meditation: The app includes a library of guided meditation sessions and relaxation techniques to reduce stress and promote mental well-being.
Community and Challenges: Users can join fitness challenges, connect with friends, and share achievements. The app fosters a supportive community to stay motivated and engaged.

## Notes

It takes me a while to figure out how to connect the UI of the button to the logic that when you click it, the background color changes randomly.
